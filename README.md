# Electric Source Imaging with Dicotomic Region Priors

Full documentation is yet to be added. In the meantime, [in this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LCpD2tslWJpND0sAfV79QxPZMI9IVbSK/view?usp=sharing) you can find some slides used to present this project.

_A grosso modo_, we construct the spatial priors based on observations from low-resolution imaging modalities. For instance, we use pictures from post-mortem symptoms of a stroke.
